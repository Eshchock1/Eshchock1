### Always building things  ðŸš€

I'm currently working on Lighthouse HQ while pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science at the University of Toronto. Previously, I co-founded [useunify.app](https://www.useunify.app/), a Figma-to-code tool accepted into [Pioneer](https://pioneer.app/). In the past, I've worked at [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/), [Ross Video](https://www.rossvideo.com/), [Bitswap](https://twitter.com/bitswapnetwork), and [SnapSmile](https://www.snapsmile.ai/). I love working on innovative solutions and meeting people working on cool things. Feel free to take a look at some of my work on GitHub or shoot me a message at [eshchock1@gmail.com](mailto:eshchock1@gmail.com).
