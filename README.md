### A 17 year old developer from Ottawa, Canada.

I’m currently working as a developer at [Monument](https://monument.app/) and pursuing a degree in computer science at the University of Toronto. I am always exploring enriching opportunities with pioneering technology I can implement to change the world. In the past, I’ve worked with [Bitswap](https://bitswap.network/), [SnapSmile](https://www.snapsmile.io/), and [Digitera.Interactive](https://digitera.agency/). In my spare time, you might find me playing badminton, coding, drawing, learning, and competing in hackathons. Feel free to take a look at some of my work on [Github](https://github.com/Eshchock1) or shoot me a [message](mailto:eshchock1@gmail.com).
