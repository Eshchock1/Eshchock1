### A 20-year-old developer from Ottawa, Canada.

Iâ€™m currently building [useunify.app](https://www.useunify.app/) while pursuing a bachelor's degree in computer science at the University of Toronto. I am always exploring enriching opportunities with pioneering technology I can implement to change the world. In the past, Iâ€™ve worked at [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/), [Ross Video](https://www.rossvideo.com/), [Bitswap](https://twitter.com/bitswapnetwork), [SnapSmile](https://www.snapsmile.ai/), and [Digitera.Interactive](https://digitera.agency/). In my spare time, you might find me playing badminton, drawing, learning, and competing in hackathons. Feel free to take a look at some of my work on GitHub or shoot me a message at eshchock1@gmail.com.
