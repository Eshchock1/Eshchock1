### A 19 year old developer from Ottawa, Canada.

Iâ€™m currently working as a Software Developer at [Ross Video](https://www.rossvideo.com/) and building [useunify.app](https://www.useunify.app/) while pursuing a degree in computer science at the University of Toronto. I am always exploring enriching opportunities with pioneering technology I can implement to change the world. In the past, Iâ€™ve worked with [Bitswap](https://bitswap.network/), [SnapSmile](https://www.snapsmile.io/), and [Digitera.Interactive](https://digitera.agency/). In my spare time, you might find me playing badminton, coding, drawing, learning, and competing in hackathons. Feel free to take a look at some of my work on Github or shoot me a message at eshchock1@gmail.com.
